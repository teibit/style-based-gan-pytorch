# Style-Based GAN in PyTorch

We used the proposed architecture in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) and from this implementation in PyTorch we trained the model with a paintings dataset.

Usage: python train.py --mixing -d {folder} PATH

However, we ran it on a cluster so we just had to execute the bash scripts.
